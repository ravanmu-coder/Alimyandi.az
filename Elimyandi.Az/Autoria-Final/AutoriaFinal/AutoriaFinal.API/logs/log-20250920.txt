The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'BidType' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.
